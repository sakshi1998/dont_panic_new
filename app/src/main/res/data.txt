My brother was recently treated for 3 weeks on Santi Gopal Hospital at Good Hospital following a major Issue. He had the most excellent professional care. The doctors and nurses were all devoted to his best outcome, were attentive to his every need and compassionate and caring towards the family informing us of every step and intervention. We are all so grateful. Thank you.,5
